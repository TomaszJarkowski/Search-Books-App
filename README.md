# Search-Books-App

Search-Book-App is an application that is used to search for a book in Google Api by title. All you need to do is enter the title of the book in the text field and you're done. A list of books will be displayed with cover photos (if no cover is available, the default photo will be displayed), title and short description. The user will only see a few books but when scroll down to download more books. The application also allows you to filter the obtained results.

Possible filters:

- author
- language
- published date
